# crudder
CRUD library, use annotated data-definition.

Crudder is a typescript library for CRUD operations, both the storage model and the ui.
It has a compact but extensive datamodel representation:
- enough properties to have a useful UI
- relations in the form of containment or references. References can be followed both ways, and can have properties like cascaded delete.
